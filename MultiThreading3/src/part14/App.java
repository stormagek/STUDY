//Threads Interruption and Interrupting Threads.
//Arguably a flaw in the Java language, because it's a checked exception that forces us to
//handle it in many occasions, but it can also be useful.

//We'll create a new thread, its run method will do some computation-intensive code.
//Look at the for-loop, if we were to use i<1E6, Finished will be printed soon after Starting.
//If we were to use i<1E7 or i<1E8, then Finished will be printed after longer time, in my case
//it was a matter of few seconds longer.

//When we do in main the following:
//t1.start(); Thread.sleep(500); t1.interrupt();
//and run it, the same thing happens, as before ( before using t1.interrupt() ), because 
//the method interrupt() doesn't kill the thread (The stop() method does that but it's 
//deprecated so we should avoid using it).

//The best way to stop/kill a thread is probably the way we've seen in lecture 2,
//using a volatile boolean flag, but we still want to understand the functionality of the
//interrupt() method.

//If we were to use a method invocation within the thread code, such as sleep(), wait(),
//or anything that throws an InterruptedException, we could then use the interrupt() method.
//He chose to use Thread.sleep(1) and added try/catch block to handle that exception.

//By running this, we can see that indeed after the t1.interrupt() method is invoked in 
//the main thread, and then the other thread (t1) invokes the sleep() method, then the
//InterruptedException gets thrown, and we can decide how to deal with that.
//He chose to do System.out.println("We've been interrupted"); break;

//The interrupt() method sets a flag in the thread upon which it's invoked.
//Now, in the run method we'll comment out the try-catch block and create an if statement.
//This flag can be inspected at any given time by a dedicated method called isInterrupted().
//Then as we can see in the code within the if statement, we can check to see if the thread
//is interrupted, and if it is, we can gracefully terminate the thread by using break if ending
//a loop will end the thread code execution, or better yet, return, to return from the run()
//method and thus terminate the thread execution.
//So the method isInterrupted() checks for that flag value to see if it's set or not.

//Now we'll examine how that'd work with a thread pool rather than a thread object.
//The example for thread pool will be shown in class App2, but explanations remain here.
//We create a cached thread pool and retrieve a value from it to Future variable -
//These things are covered in previous lectures.

//We submit a Callable to the pool, and see that the code of the Callable is 
//computation-intensive, but we have an inspection of the interrupted flag using the 
//isInterrupted() method, to check if the thread was interrupted.
//There are 2 ways we can interrupt that thread, as following:
//1. First way:
//According to the code, our program will terminate after the thread finishes, the main
//thread will just print Finished...    .
//In the main method, we'll invoke future.cancel(boolean arg) method 
//(Javadoc for this method at the end of this file).
//If the specified argument is false, the method will cancel the thread if it hasn't
//already started, but if it has already started it won't.
//If the specified argument is true, it sets the interrupted flag, even if the thread had
//already started, then using the isInterrupted() method within the thread code, we can
//inspect the flag, and if it's set we gracefully terminate the thread.
//We could use a boolean variable and use it as an argument for the cancel method, 
//to inform thread or threads to stop running and terminate gracefully.
//2. Second way:
//We'll comment out the future.cancel(true) invocation.
//In the main thread, after the sleep invocation, we'll do exec.shutdownNow(), which attempts
//to kill all running threads, but again, it doesn't really kill them, it just sets the
//interrupted flag in all running threads of the pool.
//If we run this, same thing happens, the thread runs then after some time
//(in my case from few milli seconds to few seconds) the exec.shutdownNow() method is
//invoked, the running thread's interrupted flag is set, and the thread terminates
//gracefully.
